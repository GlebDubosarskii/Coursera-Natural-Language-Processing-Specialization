## Project Language Models: Auto-Complete

In this assignment, I built develop a prototype of an auto-complete system.  Auto-complete system is something you may see every day
- When you google something, you often have suggestions to help you complete your search. 
- When you are writing an email, you get suggestions telling you possible endings to your sentence.
