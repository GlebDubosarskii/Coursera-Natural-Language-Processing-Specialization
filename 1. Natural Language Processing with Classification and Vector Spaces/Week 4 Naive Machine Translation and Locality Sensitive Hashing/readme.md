## Project Naive Machine Translation and Locality Sensitive Hashing

**First Task.** I implemented machine translation system using embedding transformation matrix. 

**Second Task.** I implemented approximate K nearest neighbors algorithm using locality sensitive hashing, to search for documents that are similar to a given document.
