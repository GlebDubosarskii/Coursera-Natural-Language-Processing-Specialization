## Project Naive Bayes for tweet sentiment analysis



You implemented Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, the algorithm decides if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Project structure is as follows: 

- Training a Naive Bayes model on a sentiment analysis task
- Testing the model
- Computing ratios of positive words to negative words
- Error analysis
- Prediction on my own tweet
